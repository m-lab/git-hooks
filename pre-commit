# This code is intended to be used as part of a submodule called git-hooks.  It
# is a language agnostic tester and linter, and should lint, test, and run
# coverage for any and all languages you happen to use.
#
# To make git run unit tests and lint tests, softlink this file into the
# .git/hooks directory of the repo you want to test.  The following command will
# get that done:
#   ln -s ../../git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# We expect that the PWD for this code is the root of the repo using git-hooks
# as a submodule.
